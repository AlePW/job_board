Open Source Job Board
=====================

This repository contains the app we will be developing during our participation in the [Rails Girls Summer of Code 2013] (http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) project.

Description of project
----------------------
The Open Source Job Board is a job board for developers built with the Cuba microframework. The application uses the developer's GitHub information as a substitution for filling out a CV and will simplify the process of applying for job offers.

The application uses the following:
- [Cuba:] (http://cuba.is/) Microframework built in Ruby.
- [Mote:] (https://github.com/soveran/mote) Minimum Operational Template.
- [Redis:] (http://www.redis.io) Open source database.
- [Ohm:] (http://soveran.github.io/ohm/) Library that allows to store objects in Redis.
- [Scrivener:] (https://github.com/soveran/scrivener) Validation frontend for models.
- [Shield:] (https://github.com/soveran/shield) Authentication library.
- [Rack-protection:] (https://github.com/rkh/rack-protection) Protects against typical web attacks.
- [Cutest:] (https://github.com/djanowski/cutest) For testing.
